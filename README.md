# OTP-UI React Component Library

## Description

React component library, which can be used to build trip planner webapps.

See:

- [Examples and docs (via Storybook)](http://www.opentripplanner.org/otp-ui/?path=/story/itinerarybody--itinerarybody-with-walk-transit-walk-itinerary-with-custom-view-trip-button-activated-and-custom-route-abbreviation)
- [Current npm releases](https://www.npmjs.com/org/opentripplanner)
- [A reference implementation of otp-ui](https://github.com/opentripplanner/otp-react-redux) -- IMPORTANT NOTE: otp-ui use in otp-rr is a WIP / TBD

## Getting Started

```bash
 git checkout https://github.com/opentripplanner/otp-ui.git
 yarn install
 yarn dev # (opens storybook to running component library on localhost:5555)
```

## Development

Some packages in otp-ui depend on sibling packages (e.g., `@opentripplanner/core-utils` is used by many of its siblings). In order to test a package with local changes you have made to its sibling, you can run the following find/replace operations to make sure you're depending on your latest work (and not the released version):

1. In the `package.json` files for packages in which you want to test the sibling, find and replace (package-to-test being the package with local changes -- make sure these are committed to first to avoid the find/replace operations below polluting your work):

   > "@opentripplanner/package-to-test": **"current-version"**

   with

   > "@opentripplanner/package-to-test": **"file:../package-to-test"**

2. Run:
   `yarn && yarn dev`

### Storyshot testing

This repo utilizes the [Storyshot](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/workflows/snapshot-testing) Storybook addon to perform snapshot tests of every story in this monorepo. Whenever the script `yarn unit` is ran, the Storyshot addon will be included along with all the other tests. It will compare the output of every story to the saved snapshot of that story. This provides a quick way to make sure nothing drastic has changed and that every single story is able to render without an error. However, often times these snapshots will need to be updated and that can be accomplished by running `yarn unit -u`.

## Usage

- `yarn dev` - This starts Storybook for viewing all the components locally.
- `yarn bootstrap` - This installs all of the packages and links dependent packages together.
- `yarn preppublish` - This babelfies all of the packages and creates `/lib` folders for each one.
- `yarn unit` - Run jest unit tests.
- `yarn coverage` - Shows jest unit coverage.
- `npx lerna changed` - Show which packages have changed.
- `npx lerna diff` - Show specifically what files have cause the packages to change.
- `npx lerna create <packageName>` - Creates new package and walks through setting up package.json

## Releasing

This project uses semantic-release to create releases to NPM. It is expect that contributors create [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) messages. These are then parsed by semantic-release which will automatically create an appropriate release for each package whenever a branch is merged to master.

Sometimes when creating new releases, it will be necessary to update numerous packages within this repo at once to a newer internal package version. For this purpose there is the `update-internal-dependencies` script. This should be ran manually as needed. By default, `yarn update-internal-dependencies` will update all dependencies with the `@opentripplanner` scope in all packages within this project. To only update specific dependencies, it is possible to run something like `yarn update-internal-dependencies core-utils base-map`. This would update all dependencies on either the `@opentripplanner/base-map` or the `@opentripplanner/core-utils` in all packages in this project.
